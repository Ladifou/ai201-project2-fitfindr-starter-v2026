     HOW TO USE THIS FILE

     This is your submission. Fill each section in as you finish the milestone
     it belongs to — don't leave it all to the end.

     Unit 3 asks for the first five sections. Unit 4 adds the five below them.
     Leave the unit 4 sections alone until then; they're here so you know
     what's coming.

     Everything is pasted as TEXT. No screenshots, no images, no video links.
     A typed block of output gets full credit; a picture of the same output
     gets none.
     ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── -->

<!-- ═══════════════════════ UNIT 3 — THE BUILD ═══════════════════════ -->

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences: what a user asks for, and what they get back. -->

---

## Tool Inventory

<!-- Four lines per tool. This is worth 2 points and it's the single most
     common place students lose them.

     "Returns a list" earns NOTHING. The description has to say what is IN
     the list.

     The empty case isn't optional either — it's the thing your loop branches
     on, and if you don't decide it here you'll discover it as a crash in
     Milestone 5. -->

### `search_listings`

- **What it does:** Search the listing list based on description and optionally a size and a price ceiling
- **Inputs:** 'description' (string), 'size' (string), 'max_price' (float)
- **Returns:** Returns a list of matching listing dictionaries
- **When it has nothing:** It returns an empty list

### `suggest_outfit`

- **What it does:** Suggests one or two outfits based on the provided item and the user's wardrobe.
- **Inputs:** 'new_item' (dictionary), 'wardrobe' (dictionary)
- **Returns:** A string witht the outfit suggestion
- **When it has nothing:** Returns a general styling advice

### `create_fit_card`

- **What it does:** Writes a short caption someone would actually post about the find.
- **Inputs:** 'outfit' (string), 'new_item' (dictionary)
- **Returns:** A 2-4 sentence caption of the find.
- **When it has nothing:** Returns a descriptive message

---

## Planning Loop

<!-- Your branch rule, stated as a rule — the condition AND both paths — plus
     the file and function that holds it.

     Like this:
       "If search_listings returns an empty list, put a message in the session
        and stop. Otherwise take the first result and go to suggest_outfit."
        — agent.py::run_agent

     The grader checks your code against what you claim here, so the file and
     function have to be real. -->

**Branch rule:** If no user wardrobe and/or item aren't provided as search fields/inputs for suggest_outfits, report on it and provide a general styling advice. - agent.py::run_agent

**Where it lives:** `agent.py::run_agent`

**How the query is parsed:** <!-- regex, string splitting, or asking the model — say which --> The query is parsed with string splitting

**What moves through the session:** <!-- which fields, in what order -->

---

## Sample Run

<!-- Two things go here.

     1. One FULL query and its output, pasted as text.
     2. Your three per-tool terminal tests — the command and what it printed. -->

**One full query**

```
$ python app.py ask '...'

```

**The three tools, tested one at a time**

```
$ python -c "from tools import search_listings; print(search_listings('graphic tee', max_price=30))"

```
$ python -c "from tools import suggest_outfit; ..."

python -c 'from tools import suggest_outfit; from utils.data_loader import get_example_wardrobe, load_listings; print(suggest_outfit(load_listings()[0], get_example_wardrobe()))'
Here are two distinct outfits featuring your vintage Levi's 501s and pieces from your wardrobe, playing with proportions and contrasting aesthetics.

### Outfit 1: Casual '90s Off-Duty (Sporty & Relaxed)
This look leans into the vintage Americana vibe of the 501s, contrasting the fitted, structured denim with relaxed, cozy layers.

*   **Top Layer:** Oversized grey crewneck sweatshirt
*   **Base Layer:** White ribbed tank top (let the white hem peek out slightly from under the grey crewneck for a styled layering effect)
*   **Shoes:** Chunky white sneakers
*   **Accessories:** Black crossbody bag (worn high across the chest for a modern, urban touch)

*Why it works:* The medium wash of the 501s pairs naturally with grey and white for a clean, effortless palette. The oversized crewneck balances the straight, classic fit of the vintage jeans, while the chunky sneakers tie the casual, retro aesthetic together.

***

### Outfit 2: Edgy Contrast (Streetwear & Tough Textures)
This look juxtaposes the classic, timeless medium-wash denim with hard black accessories and cropped tailoring for a sharper, more directional silhouette.

*   **Top Layer:** Black cropped zip hoodie worn over the White ribbed tank top (leaving the bottom zip slightly open to show the white tank and waistline).
*   **Outerwear:** Vintage black denim jacket (layered over the hoodie for a double-denim texture play).
*   **Footwear:** Black combat boots (let the hems of the 501s break slightly over the tops of the boots).
*   **Accessories:** Brown leather belt (adding a warm contrast to the heavy black elements) and Black crossbody bag.

*Why it works:* Pairing medium-wash blue denim with black outerwear creates a high-contrast look. The cropped hoodie breaks up the torso and highlights the high waist of the 501s (accentuated by the brown belt), while the combat boots ground the outfit with a tough edge.
```

```
$ python -c "from tools import create_fit_card; ..."

 python -c "from tools import create_fit_card; from utils.data_loader import load_listings; print(create_fit_card('jeans and white sneakers', load_listings()[0]))"
Nothing beats the classic fit of vintage Levi’s 501s in a timeless medium wash. Style them effortlessly with crisp white sneakers for that quintessential, off-duty cool look. Grab this wardrobe staple for just $38 before it's gone!

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. What you asked, what came back, what you changed.

     "I used Claude to help me code" is not enough.

     "I gave Claude my search_listings spec. It returned None on no match
     instead of an empty list, so I changed it" is the level we want. -->

**Moment 1**

- _What I asked for:_
- _What came back:_
- _What I changed:_

**Moment 2**

- _What I asked for:_
- _What came back:_
- _What I changed:_

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Five criteria, five tries each, in this exact format.

     Five, because your criteria are written out of five. Mark each try PASS
     or FAIL, count the passes, and read that count against your target — a
     row targeting 4 of 5 with three PASS cells is MISSED (3/5).

     `python run_eval.py --label before` runs everything and writes the table
     into results/. Paste it here and fill in the verdicts. -->

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
| --------- | ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------- |
| 1.        |        |       |       |       |       |       |         |
| 2.        |        |       |       |       |       |       |         |
| 3.        |        |       |       |       |       |       |         |
| 4.        |        |       |       |       |       |       |         |
| 5.        |        |       |       |       |       |       |         |

## Verdicts and Diagnoses

<!-- MET or MISSED per criterion against LAST UNIT's target, plus a sentence on
     how you decided.

     Then, for every miss: which of the four places it happened — a tool, the
     loop's branch, the session, or the model's output — AND the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis:  "The fit card was bad."
     A diagnosis:      "The fit card criterion missed on 2 of 5 items. Both had
                        an empty brand field. My prompt puts the brand in the
                        first sentence, so the card opened with a blank and read
                        like a fragment. The tool worked; the prompt assumed a
                        field that isn't always there."

     Look for a pattern. Three misses on the same tool is one problem, not
     three. -->

| #   | Criterion | Target | Verdict | How I decided |
| --- | --------- | ------ | ------- | ------------- |
| 1   |           |        |         |               |
| 2   |           |        |         |               |
| 3   |           |        |         |               |
| 4   |           |        |         |               |
| 5   |           |        |         |               |

**Diagnoses**

---

## Loop Trace

<!-- One full run, printed step by step, with the MCP call visible in it.

     `python app.py ask '...' --trace` once you've added the trace.step()
     calls in Milestone 2.

     Worth pasting BOTH the happy path and the empty-search path. The empty
     one should be visibly shorter, because it stops. If your two traces are
     the same length, your branch isn't working — and this is the fastest way
     anyone will ever find that out. -->

**Happy path**

```

```

**Empty search**

```

```

**On the MCP move:** <!-- what changed in your code, and whether anything
behaved differently afterwards. If the rewire didn't work, say exactly where it
broke — the error text and the last thing that worked. That earns the point in
full. -->

---

## The Improvement

<!-- What you changed, why your diagnosis pointed at it, and the after-run in
     the same table format. One change, measured properly.

     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

**What I changed:**

**Which failure it was meant to fix:**

### Run Log — After

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
| --------- | ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------- |
| 1.        |        |       |       |       |       |       |         |
| 2.        |        |       |       |       |       |       |         |
| 3.        |        |       |       |       |       |       |         |
| 4.        |        |       |       |       |       |       |         |
| 5.        |        |       |       |       |       |       |         |

**Did it help, and how do I know:**

<!-- If it made things worse, say that. Honestly reported, that earns full
     credit and is more interesting than one that worked. -->

---

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed: what you'd do, and why you stopped where
     you did. "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is
     left is not. -->
