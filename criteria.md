# Acceptance criteria — FitFindr

Five criteria that say what "working" means for this agent, written in unit 3
**before** any results existed.

An acceptance criterion names a target: a number, a count, a rate, or something
a person could plainly observe. _"The agent handles errors"_ is an opinion.
_"When search returns nothing, the agent stops before calling the second tool,
in 5 of 5 tries"_ is a criterion.

Under each one, write a sentence or two on **why that target** and not a
stricter one. A reason that says something about your tools, your loop, or the
data earns credit; _"80% seemed reasonable"_ does not.

> Missing your own targets next unit costs you nothing. Setting a target so
> easy you can't miss it does.

**Two are written for you. You write three.**

## 1. A matching query completes all three tools

Given a query that matches at least one listing, the agent completes all three
tool calls and returns a fit card — in at least 4 of 5 tries.

**Why this target:** Since searches are done with keyword match from plain text, user vocabulary may vary and it is expected for matches to fail regardless of query accuracy.

<!-- Why 4 of 5 and not 5 of 5? Something about your search, probably —
     "my search is a plain keyword match and some phrasings will miss" is a
     real answer. -->

---

## 2. An impossible query stops before the second tool

Given a query that matches no listings, the agent stops before calling
`suggest_outfit` and returns a message naming what to change — 5 of 5 tries.

**Why this target:** This ensure unnecessary model calls are made and a 5 of 5 is reasonable because a query with no match will likely return an undesirable suggestion.

<!-- Why is 5 of 5 reasonable here when criterion 1 isn't? What's different
     about this path? -->

---

## 3. Something about state

<!-- YOU WRITE THIS ONE.

     How would you know that the item your search found is the same item the
     next tool received? Name something countable or observable.

     This is the criterion people find hardest, because state failure doesn't
     look like state failure — it looks like a tool problem. Something that
     compares session["selected_item"] against what actually reached
     suggest_outfit is the shape you're after. -->

     Given a query that matches at least one listing, the selected item stored in session should be the same item passed to suggest_outfit in 5 of 5 tries.

**Why this target:**
This ensures accurate data transistion between tools. A 5 of 5 target is ideal here since it is single deterministic state check and not a probability.

---

## 4. Something about the fit card

<!-- YOU WRITE THIS ONE.

     The fit card calls a model, so the same input can produce different words
     each time. That's not a bug — it's the nature of the tool. So what would
     make it acceptable?

     Think about what you'd actually be unhappy to see. A caption that never
     mentions the price? Two different items producing the same opening
     sentence? A card longer than a caption anyone would post? Any of those can
     be turned into a number. -->

For 5 different listings, if the query includes a price ceiling, at least 4 of 5 fit cards mention the item’s price.

**Why this target:**
A caption that omits the price most of the time would feel disconnected from the request and would allow the user to make quick comparisons. A 4-of-5 target is strict enough to matter while still allowing normal variation in model output.

---

## 5. Your choice

<!-- YOU WRITE THIS ONE TOO.

     Pick something you actually care about getting right. Speed, the empty
     wardrobe path, what happens when the model can't be reached, whether the
     search respects a price ceiling — anything, as long as it names a number
     or an observable outcome. -->

If the wardrobe is empty, the agent returns a clear “no items available” message instead of calling the model or crashing in 5 of 5 tries.

**Why this target:**
This allows us to know whether the tool chain handles the empty-data case cleanly before it tries to do anything else. A strict 5-of-5 target makes sense because the code path is explicit and should be stable once the guard is in place.

     UNIT 4 — read this before you change anything above.

     If a criterion turns out to be BROKEN rather than merely unmet, you can
     revise it, and that earns credit. But never delete or edit the original
     line. Add the revision underneath it, like this:

         ## 4. Something about the fit card

         The fit card is different every time.

         **Why this target:** ...

         > **Revised in unit 4:** For 5 different items, the 5 fit cards share
         > no opening sentence.
         >
         > **Why revised:** "different" wasn't checkable — two cards that
         > differed by one word still counted. The new version is something I
         > can actually score.

     That's a revision because the criterion couldn't be MEASURED.

     Lowering a target because you missed it is not a revision, and it costs
     you the point:

         ✗ "I said the empty search stops it 5 of 5 times, but I got 3 of 5,
            so 3 of 5 is more realistic."

     A number you missed stays where it is, gets diagnosed, and gets a fix
     attempted. That's where the points are.
